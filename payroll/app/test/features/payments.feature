Feature: Payroll System Payments

  I should be able to see a list of payments for all the paid employees

 /*  Scenario: Can view a list of payment details for existing employees
    Given already paid payments
    When I open the application
    Then I can see the list of payment details for all the employees */

  /* Scenario: Can delete payments details from payment list
    Given employee 'John Card' is listed on the payment list
    And I select the delete button
    Then payment entry has no longer been listed for 'John Card' */

/* Visual validation tests */
  /* Scenario: I can see the correct UI for payments 
    When I open the application
    Then I can see payments list container with the correct components in correct position */
